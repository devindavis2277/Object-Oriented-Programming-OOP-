# Object-Oriented-Programming-OOP
Object Oriented Programming is a fundamental concept in Python, empowering developers to build modular, maintainable, and scalable applications. By understanding the core OOP principles—classes, objects, inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism—programmers can leverage the full potential of Python’s OOP capabilities to design elegant and efficient solutions to complex problems.

What is Object-Oriented Programming in Python?
In Python, object-oriented Programming (OOPs) is a programming paradigm that uses objects and classes. It aims to implement real-world entities like inheritance, polymorphisms, encapsulation, etc. in the programming. The main concept of object-oriented Programming (OOPs) or oops concepts in Python is to bind the data and the functions that work together as a single unit so that no other part of the code can access this data.

In this project, I will showcase some completed python projects relating to OOP.
